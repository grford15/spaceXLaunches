# Space-X Launches: xDesign Take-Home Challenge

## Notes

I created this challenge using React. I have also used some libraries such as *Axios* to fetch the data from the Api, *node-sass* to use SASS & I imported a method from *Lodash*.

I planned my working based around the API & the data it returns as well as trying to work as closely to the designs given. I believe I have completed this pretty well under the circumstances, there's only a few things I would change. If I had extra time I think I would have used some of the data from the API to make the list more interactive, I think it had a Wiki link to each launch which would have been good to include if the user wanted to find out more about it.

### To Run:

- Clone the repo & download it to a desired directory
- Inside in the repo directory `npm install`
- Once the packages are install `npm start` this will start the project at port 3000
